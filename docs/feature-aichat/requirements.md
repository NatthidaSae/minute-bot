| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **UR-4.1** | As a user, I want to ask questions about the content of a specific meeting transcript so I can get quick answers without reading the entire text.         |
| **UR-4.2** | As a user, I want the system to highlight or link to the exact part of the transcript related to the answer so I can verify and explore further.          |
| **UR-4.3** | As a user, I want to ask follow-up questions in a conversational manner so I can get deeper understanding across multiple turns.                          |
| **UR-4.4** | As a user, I want to ask if a certain keyword or topic has ever been discussed across previous meetings so I can track recurring discussions.             |
| **UR-4.5** | As a user, I want the system to preserve the context of my current question thread so that the follow-up answers remain relevant.                         |
